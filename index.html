        <h2>Roland FP-30 Remote Control</h2>
        <p>
            The FP-30 Remote Control uses WebMIDI / Web Bluetooth to connect to
            an FP-30 instrument and control its dashboard settings. Not all
            dashboard settings have been implemented yet.
            It has been optimized for use with mobile browsers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Both wired and BLE connections are supported. <em>Note that
            connecting via BLE takes notably longer than MIDI (10 - 15
            seconds are to be expected.)</em>
            Once the connection is established the functionality is identical.
            <em>If your browser doesn't support the BLE API no option for BLE
            will be shown.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            It is self-contained, so you can save the control panel page
            locally and open it directly.
        </p>
        <p>
            Compatible Browsers:
            <ul>
                <li>Google Chrome (<em>except on iOS / iPadOS</em>)</li>
                <li>Chromium based browsers</li>
                <li>Firefox (since 108, <em>Desktop only, no Bluetooth</em>)</li>
            </ul>
            Incompatible Browsers:
            <ul>
                <li>Safari (Apple refuses to implement WebMIDI in WebKit)</li>
                <li>Google Chrome on iOS / iPadOS (Apple forces browsers to use
                    WebKit)</li>
            </ul>
        <p>
            The page uses the browsers local storage to store
        </p>
            <ul>
                <li>selected MIDI device: (try to) reconnect on load.</li>
            </ul>
        <p>
            This is considered experimental.
            <em>It has only been tested with the FP-30.</em>
            Instruments using the same mobile App (FP-10, FP-60) might
            (partially) work.  Other instruments (especially newer instruments
            like the FP-30X) might work, not work, or end up doing weird
            things.
            <b>Use at your own risk.</b>
